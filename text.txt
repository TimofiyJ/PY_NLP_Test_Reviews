i received the item a few days ago i was verypleasantly surprised how beautiful the item was the detail was excellent and the photo looked 3d i received so many compliments on it i did make a huge mistake on it i put a date of 1974 when it should have been 1973 i can't believe i did that it was totally my fault that takes away something from it for me there's nothing i can do about it now thank you for everything your and yourteam did you do excellent work and it's a memory that will last a lifetime i will let everyone who i show it to see how your company is the best thanks again tammy logan;
to whom it may concerned hi i purchased a item a while back and i just am very disappointed on the outcome first of all the shipment was over the due date which you guys promised second this item came with no light base which i'm seeing my receipt and it said i clicked on "no base" which must be a malfunction because what's the point of getting a 120$ item with no lights finally what is this why are you charging so much for something that fits in my pocket listen i get we are in a crisis but please don't screw your employees these are memories to cherish not something to play hide and seek with thank you

morning ellen yesterday june 18th was our 15 year anniversary and my husband finally opened his gift wrapped cube he liked the present but i do have to share with you that i am a little disappointed about the way it turned out this has to do with how the preview looked like and the reality in regards to his head in the cube looks like it does not fit properly in the cube/ there is not enough space left on top i am attaching pics of preview and reality otherwise i like it thanks justin get outlook for ios
thank you for sending my item emily however am disappointed that it’s not in color the picture appears in grey that’s not the kind of memory i was looking for is it possible to have it in color and then is it possible to send it in any other color other than black please find something that’s not in a form of a casket a regular padded box would be nice otherwise if the order cannot be altered then am afraid i would like a refund because i will have no use for itthen am so sorry i did not know thati was supposed to request these specifics in detail i assumed the picture would appear in color as it is thank you for considering my request sincerely nancy snydersent from yahoo mail for iphone

order #658 205 051953 i just received it today i just wanted to tell you how much i love the two units you made for in remembering my wife that we lost sept 2020 these are christmas gifts for a friend and my son and daughter in law i had previously order the small units but they are to small the large ones are excellent and i am sure the kids and friends will love them now i will have to be ordering one for me thank you
i received my item on 11/19/2022 it cost me $139 00 and i am not impressed the photo is a picture of me and my sister parts of the picture appear to be exposed twice it looks like i have 4 eyes and my sister has two sets of upper teeth even the print is exposed twice the words “always” and “my” have a shadow behind the word i’m not impressed ideally i would like a new one that looks acceptable and like the picture if this is not possible i would like a refund thanks 
we are very disappointed with the image quality of our most recent order #848235987589 the image of our kitty jessica is pale and flat and the tip of his back ear is clipped ironically we expressly contacted your company with this concern prior to ordering and were assured a team member would carefully adjust the image and cropping our previous order of our cat karen was perfect: luminous dimensional fully rendered & well cropped it was based on this result that we placed this order we would like your company to correct and replace this item with a similar quality image our desire is to focus more on jessica’s head and ears than his legs if there isn’t space to do that in the item without reducing image size we can re crop the image and send it to your company the depth and luminosity of the image also needs to be enhanced please contact us

i’m looking forward to the email where i can rate your product the timeless item blew away our expectations my dad lost his wife and i was looking for a way to celebrate her memory this christmas he cried when he opened the box and saw her beautiful likeness encased in the item when he placed the piece on the lit stand it was absolutely gorgeous you guys knocked it out of the park he has sent me several texts since christmas day to tell me how much he loves the gift this is a man of very few words and even fewer texts “she is now resting on his nightstand and watching over him thank you p s i’ll need to order another kit stand b/c he wants to keep it on permanently and i’m not sure how long the lights are meant to last forwarded message 
 message today was my 12th anniversary and my wife opened her wrapped gift i had the opportunity to see it for the first time she was impressed but i was disappointed in the fact that the lettering " i love you" was crooked/ on a slant at $ 143 for the piece that mistake was disappointing 
thank you but i was saying i thought the item itself was going to be bigger since it was a large it’s beautiful in every kind of way i thank you all i’m sending this again because maybe you didn’t receive it the first time sent from my iphone
mr lans thank you for this email and the opportunity to let you know about the finished product that i received yesterday my husband christopher helped me order this item gift for a good friend who lost her daughter kimberly i’ve ordered these 3d products before with wonderful results but i’m wondering now if maybe it was from a different company because i must tell you i was very disappointed with the end result of this one it’s very hard to see exactly what the finished product is going to look like on a computer screen so thought choosing the heart design would work but it didn’t at all the bottom of the heart looks like it’s making a “dent” in the top of kimberly’s head so there is no way i could possibility send this to my friend i think your system should be able to advise you if the image submitted would not be a good fit and allow you to either choose a different item or perhaps suggest you selected a larger size heart if given the choice for only $20 more i could have chosen the large item “brick” which would have looked much better i was also surprised at how small the “medium” heart was and the $60 jump in cost for the large size so with all this being said i’d like to know what my options are and if it’s possible to return this item for a full refund or perhaps a reorder of something else thanks for your help pamela peterson; sent from my ipad begin forwarded message:

hey i’m finally home and able to check out the gift and i’m a little disappointed in the writing and numbering that’s on there i don’t understand why wasn’t the date present in regular numbers and why was they writing so difficult to read there should’ve been a demo on that so we could pick something else you can’t even read what it says and i’m highly disappointed in that the items fine it’s not what i expected but it’ll work but the writing is very difficult for me to like hopefully they’ll see the effort in the gift but i am saddened by the writing brian thomas c: 951 526 3972

i received my purchase today and opened the boxes to see the product before i wrap them to give as a gift to my wife i am extremely disappointed in the led base that i purchased i ordered the xxl item and the base is absolutely too small the item hangs off both sides of the base when centered none of your examples that i saw showed a item larger than the base in fact the xxl item on your page fit nicely on a base larger than the item did i receive the wrong base 
i received the base today it fits perfect and my item is beautiful thankyou so much for your help my dad said he left a good review original message 
i wrote a review and tried to submit it but it wouldn't let me this is what i wrote: i absolutely love these your company heart memories i ordered i have ordered 5 of them now and plan to order more as needed every person i have given them to has loved them they are literally your company and don't loose their look at all i would highly recommend these to whoever wants a really cool and really neat and unusual gift to give someone i gave it the highest rating and titled it "your company choice" maybe you can figure out how to get it to post 
good afternoon thank you for the order i was very surprised that you were able to get it to me early arrived yesterday the kids and i gave it to my wife today and she absolutely loved it the detail in the picture is truly exceptional and your quick responses to my questions shows your excellent customer service i would definitely recommend your company to anyone looking a special gift thanks again and have a great day gerald clark sent from my iphone >

hi martha just wanted to pop in and thank you for the amazing work my mom absolutely loved her gift we lost my grandma a month ago who was the matriarch of our family and my mom is undergoing chemo for breast cancer so it is a hard time for our family but since i gave my mom the gift this morning she has not put it down and can’t stop talking about it thank you so much for making my moms mothers day wishing a happy mother’s day to you all william obrien﻿
we received our order on 11/11 and the item was beautiful we were however disappointed with the light base as it does not offer a battery option and must be plugged in limiting the locations it can be placed i did not notice in the description on the website what the power source was i will need to purchase a 3rd party base to be able to place in appropriate location respectfully michael chase
