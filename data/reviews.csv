  I just received my order! I have to say- I was moved to tears. The details and clarity is just stunning! I got your company information from a client of mine, who received one of your pieces, and she was moved to tears as well. My piece is also a gift, and I cannot wait to give it to Him! Thank You so much!

We received the heart but sadly are disappointed that there are two scratches on the front face of the heart, the top one being the worst. I have attached pictures so you can see what I’m referring to. I’d like to get redone and want to know the process.

Thanks,

245,"I am not satisfied with the quality of the items I order, the items itself had a very cloudy look and the picture isn’t as clear because of this, this is a father day gift to my husband who lost his mother last year and father says was always a big deals for her because of how proud she was of him and the father he is to our daughter, and his step kids. 70 dollar for a items of such poor quality is a disappointment.

The picture is very dull and cannot be seen and the picture does not appear on the other 2 dimensions of the cube. Also I feel scammed, I paid $45 for this and I expected so much more. Not only is it small, it is not of good quality. I would like a refund because I cannot except this."

 I just wanted to tell you, we got our item today (June 18,2020). It's better than any of the pictures you sent. My mother was ecstatic. She loved it.

173,Well I am very disappointed with this order that I paid a lot of money for. The photo in the larger item looks terrible and is short on both sides about 1/2”. Meaning unlike my last order with the larger item this order the 3 item photos were not made available for enough and it looks terrible. I am not satisfied at all and now will not ever leave a good review. This is poor quality.

56,"Hi The item photo you made I am not happy with it. 1) The face in the engraving is different than the Original photo face. 2) The quality of engraving is so poor I can’t see the object Clear enough without light. 3) even with the lights I can’t see much object because engraving Quality was so poor.         4) if you want to try second time do it so.  Then if the quality comes out same like this,  I want to get my money back. 5). I called you the phone number listed on the website but you don’t answer. It’s very suspicious that you don’t take customers phone call . Why don’t you give me a call so I can explain how the quality has to be. My phone number is 625-836-9563 thank you

I did make a  huge mistake on it. I put a date of 1974 when it should have been 1973. I can't believe I did that. It was  totally my fault. That takes away something from it for me. There's nothing I can do about it now.  
  Thank You for everything your and yourteam did. You do excellent work and it's a memory that will last  a lifetime! I will let everyone who I show it to see how your company is the best. Thanks again, Tammy Logan;"
214,"To whom it may concerned, 
  Hi I purchased a item a while back and I just am very disappointed on the outcome.  
  First of all, the shipment was over the due date which you guys promised, second this item came with no light base which I'm seeing my receipt and it said I clicked on ""no base"" which must be a malfunction because what's the point of getting a 120$ item with no lights. FINALLY, what is this? Why are you charging so much for something that fits in my pocket?  
  Listen I get we are in a crisis but please don't screw your employees. These are memories to cherish not something to play hide and seek with.  
  Thank you."

 Yesterday, June 18th, was our 15 year anniversary, and my husband finally opened his gift wrapped cube. He liked the present, but I do have to share with you that I am a little disappointed about the way it turned out. This has
 to do with how the preview looked like and the reality in regards to his head in the cube looks like it does not fit properly in the cube/ there is not enough space left on top. I am attaching pics of preview and reality. Otherwise, I like it.

Is it possible to have it in color?And then is it possible to send it in any other color other than black. Please find something that’s not in a form of a casket. A regular padded box would be nice.    Otherwise if the order cannot be altered then am afraid I would like a refund because I will have no use for itthen.

It looks like I have 4 eyes and my sister has two sets of upper teeth. Even the print is exposed twice. The words “always” and “my” have a shadow behind the word. I’m not impressed.   Ideally I would like a new one that looks acceptable and like the picture. If this is not possible I would like a refund. 
Thanks."
25,"We are very disappointed with the image quality of our most recent order (#848235987589). The image of our kitty (Jessica) is pale and flat, and the tip of his back ear is clipped. Ironically, we expressly contacted your company with this concern prior to ordering and were assured a team member would carefully adjust the image and cropping! Our previous order (of our cat Karen) was perfect: luminous, dimensional, fully rendered & well cropped. It was based on this result that we placed this order. We would like your company to correct and replace this item with a similar quality image. Our desire is to focus more on Jessica’s head and ears than his legs. If there isn’t space to do that in the item without reducing image size, we can re-crop the image and send it to your company. The depth and luminosity of the image also needs to be enhanced. Please contact us."

31,"Mr. Lans, 
  Thank you for this email and the opportunity to let you know about the finished product that I received yesterday. My husband Christopher, helped me order this item gift for a good friend who lost her daughter Kimberly. I’ve ordered these 3D products before with wonderful results, but I’m wondering now if maybe it was from a different company because I must tell you I was VERY disappointed with the end result of this one. It’s very hard to see exactly what the finished product is going to look like on a computer screen, so thought choosing the heart design would work. But it didn’t at all. The bottom of the heart looks like it’s making a “dent” in the top of Kimberly’s head. So there is no way I could possibility send this to my friend. I think your system should be able to advise you if the image submitted would not be a good fit and allow you to either choose a different item or perhaps suggest you selected a larger size heart. If given the choice, (for only $20 more) I could have chosen the large item “brick” which would have looked much better. I was also surprised at how small the “medium” heart was and the $60 jump in cost for the large size.   
  So with all this being said, I’d like to know what my options are and if it’s possible to return this item for a full refund OR perhaps a reorder of something else.   
  Thanks for your help.

 I bought this item for my wife. The images online show the item with pictures so clearly. Our picture barely shows. It looks like just. A big glass piece. Also the item shows it with the base and even shows the base separate. However I did not receive a base. So I spent $100 on a piece of glass no base with photo barely noticeable? I am not satisfied with this and I know she won’t be."

  I would like to start by saying I'm really excited for my 3D Item, which is a gift for a close friend, that I just ordered. I write this email to request some help with my order. Firstly, I wanted to ask , if possible, that no receipts or invoices be included in the packaging as my order is going to be shipped directly to the recipient of the gift and I would prefer them not knowing any amounts. Secondly, I understand that times are challenging right now and you guys are probably very busy but again, if possible, the order be prioritized in any way so that it is delivered closer to November 30th, 2020 as this is the birthday of the recipient and it would be awesome if they received their present on or around their birthday.  
  I acknowledge my requests maybe be unusual but whatever you guys can do, would mean a lot to me!

93,I have received my gift for my wife… and the rotating light base that I paid for is not in the box?? Please contact me asap.. I spent 144.00 on this item and I’m very disappointed at this point.. this picture is of our baby who we lost this year
80,"Emily, I just want to say that i took your word for it & ordered the item even though i couldn’t preview it correctly due to the dark colors & oh my goodness it turned out sooooo perfect! I don’t know how you guys do it, but the money i spent was absolutely worth it. My boyfriend loved it & i couldn’t be anymore happier then what i already am with the way it turned out. Shipping was so fast even with COVID going on. I am so happy & thank you soooo soooo much for being so helpful & reassuring me that i would in fact get it in time & that you guys would make sure the picture showed up. Again thanks a million. I will definitely be recommending this to others! Hope you have an AMAZING day. 
  Thanks again,  Michael

112,"Ordered the small item and I have seen these before but they were on a base with a light. What I received was just a block of item, if course it had the picture I chose in it but for $ 69.00 base price plus shipping tax was $ 85.00 for that price I was extremely disappointed that was not on a base with light. Can someone explain what I missed in the site I ordered from.."

 I just received my order and after eagerly waiting for my item, I am extremely disappointed because I have NO IDEA WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE!!!! That is not a memory of my deceased loved one! How can you have made such a horrible mistake! I am heart broken! How will you rectify this?"
302,"Alexandria Foster. I received the heart I ordered Last Friday October 30, 2020.  I LOVE IT, FANTASTIC.  I know my girlfriend will love it as well..  I cannot post a good review on Facebook atthis time. Afraid she might see a comment. But after Christmas I will definitely leave a good, excellent review.  And I will be a continued customer.  THANK YOU"

The picture I used was of my brother who passed away in September and I ordered this for my mom. It is incredible and she is going to love it (and cry a lot.) Thank you so much for this wonderful gift, I can't wait to place my next order for a larger size!

257,Yes my keychain arrived but was disappointed as the light up feature did not work.  The etching is nice but it would be easier to see if the light worked.  I don.t think it was the batteries but rather the light assembly.
248,"Sirs,    I am somewhat disappointed in how this item turned out. I am attaching the original picture I submitted and a picture of the finished item. While the dog’s head and forelimbs are nicely rendered, the back is obliterated by a rectangle that looks like the grass he was sitting on but everyone who sees this asks what that rectangle is doing there. Would you please consider redoing this item isolating the dog and the frisbee from the rectangle of grass?   Thank you."
126,"Thanks David for sending replacement with background. I am still not convinced with the quality of the item as it looks like different person on the side view. May be due to the picture chosen 3D did not come accurately.

165,"﻿Hello,

I opened up my order and immediately noticed that part of the corner had chipped off. I also looked and was not happy with the way the engraving turned out. I got a picture of my dog and the bottom part of his beard is missing and not shown clearly in the picture, which is not how it looked in the preview. 

I am not satisfied with the product I have received as it came damaged and does not reflect the picture I wanted to portray. 

Please let me know how your company can resolve this issue. 

Regards,

Rebecca Walker

305,"Hi Bruce: 
  Thank you for remaking the item for me (and for Christopher) ... I really appreciate it! Sorry it was such a horrible picture to work from. Again, there were only a couple of photos to choose from and that was the better of the two. But thank you, thank you, thank you for going above and beyond and “tweaking it” even though my widow’s peak (and how it appeared in the picture that I provided to you) was none of Your Company Memories’ fault.  
  I’m looking forward to receiving on Wednesday and also to giving it to Christopher for Christmas! I will definitely leave a wonderful review upon receipt! Thank you for the quick turnaround and shipping and fantastic customer service!

The front part of the pit bull looks great. The back looks awful. What was suppose to be the back legs, looks like two testicles. I showed it to my neighbor who is an artist, and she said what nice artwork and the male pit bull looks great. Problem is, Tiffany was a female. I then showed it to people who knew Tiffany and they all asked if I knew Tiffany was a female or why did I make Tiffany a male, as if I was trying to be funny. I am

not comfortable giving this to my best friend. I already e-mailed this address last Wednesday and did not hear back from your company. Please help rectify this problem. Thank you. Danielle Novak hunterrobertson@gmail.com

75,"To whom it may concern,
 
  Unfortunately, I did receive the package in its entirety- included was only with only the led wood light stand included. The item itself was not- which is beyond bizarre. I needed this very special yet highly emotional time by a specific timeframe and at this point, that has passed. With that being said, I am extremely disappointed and request a refund for my order please.

63,"Hi
I am a new customer that recently purchased a gift from you for my wife for our 30th wedding anniversary.
My order number is 946876961409
When I received your product yesterday I was very disappointed in how this tower item looked.
I spent over $100.00 for this product hoping that (based on all the positive reviews) this would be a nice gift for my wife.
My disappointment/concern is that you can barely see the picture and our anniversary date inside the item!
You can ONLY see these if you put something behind the item that is black which allows the viewer to more easily see the picture and the date.
I would really appreciate a response/action on this please as I really want to like this item but in no way am I satisfied right now. I was hoping to leave a positive review on various social media platforms but am not going to do this until resolved.
Please contact me either by phone or e mail. Cell is 5429369202  e mail michaelrose@hotmail.com

299,"To Whom It May Concern: 

 First off I wish to let you know that I received this order today.  The second thing I wish to tell you is: THANK YOU  from the bottom of my soul for getting this project done so quickly and it truly is stunning.  It represents my son’s spirit so well.  I am truly grateful that I saw this when I did, must have been shown this by my son’s spirit.  It is something that will never fade with time, unlike photos and allows me to visualize him when I need to.  Tammy’s death was sudden and devastating for us, but this will help with remembering him. 

 Again thank you so much for putting so much love and care and attention into this for us. 

 Sincerely  

 Kenneth Waller"
129,Hello I purchased 3 items 2/21/2021 and just recently opened them all for birthday gifts. I have minor issues with with two of them. My first issue is that I purchased a heart shape item with a rotating base but when it rotates the item moves on the platform. I was hoping to trade it in for a regular base or get a refund for the base. My second problem is that on another item I purchased there was a date on the picture but it did not show up on the item I want to know if I can send it back to get the picture either redone with the date on it or get the date written on the item.
283,"We received our items today and they are fabulous; thank you.

124,"Hey I’m finally home and able to check out the gift and I’m a little disappointed in the writing and numbering that’s on there. I don’t understand why wasn’t the date present in regular numbers? And why was they writing so difficult to read? There should’ve been a demo on that so we could pick something else ! You can’t even read what it says and I’m highly disappointed in that ! The items fine it’s not what I expected but it’ll work, but the writing is very difficult for me to like! Hopefully they’ll see the effort in the gift but I am saddened by the writing!

The block i received does not come close to what you show on your website. The picture is very hard to see clearly and it is much smaller than the block. So disappointed.

I received my brick item and although I think it’s incredible technology I’m disappointed with the quality of the piece. As you can see the preview and what I actually got. Bryan turned out perfectly but Nicole’s nose got cut off. What a shame, it was going to be a wedding gift, now it’s an expensive paper weight. I can only hope that my experience is a rare occurrence. Better luck next time. Sincerely frank31@hotmail.com

 Hello, I love your product. I ordered one for my husband 2 years ago and everyone loves it!!  Just 2 weeks ago I ordered one for my son as an engagement present, and I was a little disappointed in the quality.  He looks ghostly in his item, whereas my husband and I look very 3 dimensional in our item.  Would you take a look at it and see if it is the highest quality you normally produce?
Thank you! I can send you a picture of my earlier item if that would  help."

  Yes, I have received my order. It is a Christmas gift so it has not been opened by the person it was made for. I checked it and think it’s great!  Thank you!  Jared Poole;"
191,"Ann Thank you. I love my product. There is a blemish on it where it looks like a piece of tape that illuminates when put on the base. Its noticable but it may be because of how the cats whiskers had to be done. Wasn't expecting that in such a fine product and at what I paid but it's no big deal I suppose. Just looks odd. Very happy otherwise.

260,"Hello Mr. Rachel, 

 I am sending this email in reference to order #660402923168. This order was a special gift for my loving Aunt. Although my aunt LOVED her item, I was very disappointed to learn the image of my late grandmother (aunt's sister) was omitted from the item. During the order process, I requested three individual's images (see attached) to be included in the item. Unfortunately, there are only two images. Please let me know how this matter can be rectified. Thank you for your time! 

 Regretfully,

106,It was horrible   Was not happy at all with the product.   It was not as advertised.  In addition I should not have to pay for return shipping as it was your company’s  error  I would like the shipping  charges credited back to my charge card.

 I was disappointed to see that the message was not included on the piece. Since it was wrapped so beautifully, I didn't open it until our anniversary. Picture attached. Can you send a corrected piece? 



 Thanks,

 I received my order and it looks wonderful. Outstanding job, but there 

is one issue. The Additional text. It was to read: 

 Presented to:

 But it was engraved as

 The rearranging changes the meaning of the presentation piece. Is it 

possible to get this Item reworked or produce a new one that says:

 She is Martin but goes by Ray. I will be happy to send back the 

original piece. The Graphic came out Amazing!

 I just received my order and I am really disappointed. My order number is 663-277-603069. It definitely doesn’t look as bright and defined as the description promised. I can hardly see the picture and it’s only barely visible when it’s on the stand with the light. The stand itself is poorly made and has couple of scratches and when rotates it’s crooked. Very upset with my order, it was supposed to have been an anniversary present.

161,I received my purchase today and opened the boxes to see the product before I wrap them to give as a gift to my wife. I am extremely disappointed in the LED base that I purchased. I ordered the XXL item and the base is absolutely  too small. The item hangs off both sides of the base when centered. None of your examples that I saw showed a item larger than the base. In fact the XXL item on your page fit nicely on a base larger than the item. Did I receive the wrong base?

Just wanted to pop in and thank you for the amazing work. My mom absolutely loved her gift - we lost my grandma a month ago who was the matriarch of our family, and my mom is undergoing chemo for breast cancer so it is a hard time for our family. But since I gave my mom the gift this morning, she has not put it down and can’t stop talking about it. Thank you so much for making my moms Mothers Day! Wishing a Happy Mother’s Day to you all.

We were however disappointed with the light base as it does not offer a battery option and must be plugged in limiting the locations it can be placed.  I did not notice in the description on the website what the power source was.  I will need to purchase a 3rd party base to be able to place in appropriate location.
